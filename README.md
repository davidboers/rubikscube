# Rubik's Cube

This is a small Rubik's cube software I wrote for fun. It is my first F# project, and was intended to help me learn the language.

Wikipedia has a number of super helpful articles that explain the nerdy side of Rubik's cubes, such as:

* [Rubik's Cube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubik%27s_Cube)
* [Rubik's Cube group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubik%27s_Cube_group)

To run the software, `cd` to `src/RubiksCube` and run:

```bash
$ dotnet run
```
